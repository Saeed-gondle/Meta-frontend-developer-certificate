# Version Control

## Course Section Overview

This section of the Meta Frontend Developer Certificate focuses on **Version Control** fundamentals using Git and GitHub.

### What's Covered

- **Git Basics**: Understanding version control concepts and Git workflow
- **Terminal Commands**: Learning essential command-line operations for Git
- **GitHub Integration**: Working with remote repositories and collaboration
- **Branching & Merging**: Managing different versions of code
- **Git Best Practices**: Professional development workflows

### Why No Code Files?

This section primarily involves:
- **Terminal/Command Line Practice**: Most work is done through Git commands in the terminal
- **Repository Management**: Learning to initialize, clone, and manage Git repositories
- **Workflow Understanding**: Conceptual learning about version control processes

The practical exercises focus on using Git commands rather than writing application code, which is why this folder doesn't contain programming files like the other course sections.

### Key Skills Learned

- ✅ Git initialization and basic commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`)
- ✅ Remote repository management (`git push`, `git pull`, `git clone`)
- ✅ Branching strategies (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`)
